1. Strings (data that represent text or a series of text)
2. Numbers
3. Booleans (true or false statements)
4. Objects (things with state and behavior)
5. Functions (a block of organized, reusable computer code used to perform a single, related action—also called a subprogram or subroutine)
6. Values that are undefined

In JavaScript, an “object” is a type of data that represents a thing through its various properties (characteristics – what it looks like) and behavior (what it can do). 
An example of an object would be a “vehicle”. Thinking of this common real-world thing as an “object” that will be stored in computer memory and kept track of as a program is executed, we can think of various properties and behavior for it. 
Under properties, we could have things like “chassis type”, “engine type”, “number of doors”, “speed”, etc. 
Under behavior, we could have things like “accelerate”, “deccelerate”, “turn right”, “turn left”, etc.

<i>
Computer programs contain subprograms within them in order execute routine functions. You execute a function by #008080nvoking it.
In JavaScript, a function is called by stating the word function, then the name of the function followed by parentheses: function name(). 
<u>Functions are basically objects, because they can be used over and over, called upon again and again.</u> 
Example of a function: function add(num1, num2) {return num1 + num2;var sum = add(5, 7);</i>

<b>In JavaScript, a method is a set of code associated with an object. A method is an action that an object can perform.
